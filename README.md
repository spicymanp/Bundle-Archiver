# fika-bundle-transporter aka SPT Bundle-Bundler

An easy way to for the server host to find mod bundles (of installed mods) and create a compressed copy to send to friends who you intend on playing coop with.

This method is far more efficient in my opinion than relying on fika to respond to client requests for mod bundles especially when dealing with large mods.
