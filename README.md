# Bundle Archiver v1.0.0

## What is this?

-   Do you use FIKA for SPT?
-   Are you using server mods that add gear/weapons/weapon skins etc.?
-   Does your game take forever to load or even crash on launch?
-   You may be experiencing "bundle problems."
-   Have a look at the [Fika FAQ on Discord](https://discord.com/channels/1202292159366037545/1234332919443488799/1235518309882007552) if you need more info about this problem.
-   Some server mods need to send all of the clients bundles of files so the mod works. This can take a long time and/or crash tarkov.
-   This helps solve this problem in a few simple steps by automating the finding of mod bundles and conveniently zipping them up to easily share with friends.
-   This mitigates the need for the often time-consuming server-client bundle process.
