# Bundle Archiver

a utilitarian Project Fika for SPT script.

An easy way to for the server host to find currently installed mod bundles and create a compressed copy to send to friends, subverting the need to wait for the host-server to send clients these bundles, hopefully saving everyone time and frustration.

This is just an option other than having to rely on fika to respond to client requests for mod bundles and can be much quicker especially when dealing many mods or large ones.
