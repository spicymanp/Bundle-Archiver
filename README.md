# Bundle Archiver v1.0.0

## WHAT IS THIS?

- Are you using server mods that add gear/weapons/weapon skins etc.? 
- Does your game take forever to load or even crash on launch?
- You may be experiencing "bundle problems." 
- Some server mods need to send all of the clients bundles of files so the mod works. This can take a long time and/or crash tarkov. 
- This helps solve this problem in a few simple steps by automating the finding of mod bundles and conveniently zipping them up to easily share with friends. 
- This mitigates the need for the often time-consuming server-client bundle process.
