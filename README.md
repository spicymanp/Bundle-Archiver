# Bundle Archiver

| WHAT IS THIS |

A simple script that finds all mod bundles and conveniently zips them up to easily share with friends, mitigating the need for the slow server-client bundles process.

| INSTRUCTIONS - SERVER/HOST |

- Place the Bundle-Archiver.exe into your SPT root directory.
- Once the script has completed, find the zipped archive 'modBundles.zip' in your SPT root.
- Share this file with any friends who need it.

| INSTRUCTIONS - CLIENT |

- Once your friends have the zipped archive they need to extract the contents into the root of their SPT directory.

- Enjoy your co-op SPT experience.
